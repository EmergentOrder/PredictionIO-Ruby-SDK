PredictionIO Ruby SDK
=====================

The Ruby SDK provides a convenient API to quickly record your users' behavior
and retrieve personalized predictions for them.

The SDK requires Ruby 1.9.3+ to function properly.


Installation
------------

Simply run `rake gem` followed by `gem install pkg/predictionio-0.1.0.gem`.


Usage
-----

The SDK is fully documented by RDoc. You can access the documentation installed
by the gem, or run `rdoc` at the root of the repository. The documentation will
be generated in the `doc` directory.

A copy of the latest documentation is also generously hosted by RubyDoc.info at http://rubydoc.info/github/PredictionIO/PredictionIO-Ruby-SDK/frames.
