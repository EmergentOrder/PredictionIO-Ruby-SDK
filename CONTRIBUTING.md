Contributing to the PredictionIO Ruby SDK
=========================================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PredictionIO Ruby SDK!

We are building this software together and strongly encourage contributions
from the community that are within the guidelines set forth below.


Bug Fixes and New Features
--------------------------

As your first step, please visit and read the [Contributor License Agreement]
(http://prediction.io/cla). All contributors are required to sign this
agreement.


Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets]
(https://predictionio.atlassian.net/browse/SDKRUBY) or [create one]
(https://predictionio.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) 
for your bug, issue, or feature request. This helps the community
avoid working on something that might not be of interest or which
has already been addressed.


Environment
-----------

We highly suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv]
(https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to set up Ruby development and
testing environments. In this way, moving between and testing code for
alternate Ruby versions (besides the one possibly included with your 
system) is simple. This practice is essential for ensuring the quality
of the SDK.


Pull Requests
-------------

The SDK follows the [git-flow]
(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model where all
active development goes to the develop branch, and releases go to the master
branch. Pull requests should be made against the develop branch and include
relevant tests, if applicable.
